# Parsera
Lightweight library for scraping web-sites with LLMs. 
You can check how it works on [Parsera website](https://parsera.org).

## Installation

```shell
pip install parsera
playwright install
```

## Basic usage

If you want to use OpenAI, remember to set up `OPENAI_API_KEY` env variable.
You can do this from python with:
```python
import os

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE"
```

Next you can run a basic version that uses `gpt-4o-mini`
```python
from parsera import Parsera

url = "https://news.ycombinator.com/"
elements = {
    "Title": "News title",
    "Points": "Number of points",
    "Comments": "Number of comments",
}

scrapper = Parsera()
result = scrapper.run(url=url, elements=elements)
```

`result` variable will contain a json with a list of records:
```json
[
   {
      "Title":"Hacking the largest airline and hotel rewards platform (2023)",
      "Points":"104",
      "Comments":"24"
   },
    ...
]
```
